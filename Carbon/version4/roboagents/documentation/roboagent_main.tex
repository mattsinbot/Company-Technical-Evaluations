Robotic tasks, like reaching a pre-grasp configuration, are specified in the end effector space or task space, whereas, robot motion is controlled in joint space. Because of inherent actuation errors in joint space, robots cannot achieve desired configurations in task space exactly. Furthermore, for redundant manipulators, mapping of joint space error set to that of task space is a map of one to many i.e., for the same reaching task, different inverse kinematics solutions maps joint space error set to task space differently. In this paper we present strategy to choose inverse kinematics solution of redundant manipulators with actuation uncertainties (errors) for a specified task that will have least task space error. We call this particular IK as robust-IK. To obtain such IK we propose two key steps, at first obtain all possible task space errors as a bounded sets for different IKs and then choose one particular IK which has minimum task space error bound with respect to a given task. We devise set theoretic approach to bound all possible joint space errors and obtain task space error bound by mapping it through position and rotation kinematics of the manipulator. We empirically establish using statistical synthesis the fact that these task space error bounds were able to accommodate more than $98.5\%$ of all task space errors. Further usefulness of robust-IK has been presented for positioning tasks using simulations and experiments.
